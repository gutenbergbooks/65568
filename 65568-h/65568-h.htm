  <h2 id='chap1' class='c005'>Chapter I <br /> TIME TO RUN AWAY</h2>
</div>
<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Runaway Rabbit has formed the habit</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of running away, I see.</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh, Runaway Rabbit, please form the habit</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of staying awhile with me.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Runaway Rabbit sat on the
doorstep of his own little house, saying,
“By my cottontail, it is time for
me to run away!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He took out his little brown traveling
bag and packed it full.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/fig02.jpg' alt='“Packed it full”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Packed it full”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>He was in such a hurry to run away
that he did not even stop to clear off
<a id='Page_viii'></a>his breakfast table. He did not even
stop to wind his clock or lock his
front door!</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippety-hop, lippety-lop, he went
down the path, carrying his little
brown traveling bag.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where are you going?” asked the
Whistling Wind.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where are you going?” asked the
Smiling Sun.</p>

<p class='c007'>To them both, the Runaway Bunny
replied:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_ix'></a>“Oho! I’m happy to have such fun;</div>
      <div class='line'>It’s such a pleasure to run and run!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He did not tell anyone where he was
going. Many years ago he had made
up his mind that some day he would
<a id='Page_x'></a>run away and visit his grandparents.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now wasn’t it funny? At this very
minute Old Mother Bun was saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“My old legs get so stiff; it’s funny!</div>
      <div class='line'>I wish I had a little Bunny!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>She wanted a little Bunny to travel
up and down the cellar stairs for her.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this very minute Old Father Bun
was saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I would pay a mint of money</div>
      <div class='line'>If I had a visiting Bunny!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He wanted a little Rabbit to bring
in wood and water.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/fig03.jpg' alt='“Took out her field glasses”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Took out her field glasses”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly, without any warning
whatever, Old Mother Bun took out
her field glasses. And as she looked
out of the window she remarked, “I
think I see a little figure away over in
<a id='Page_xi'></a>the field coming this way very fast!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Father Bun put his long ears
close to the window to listen.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had wonderful hearing, and he
said, “I think I hear the far-off patter,
patter, patter of little feet. Some one
is coming. He should be here in five
minutes.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<a id='Page_xii'></a><img src='images/fig04.jpg' alt='“Father Bun took out his watch”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Father Bun took out his watch”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Father Bun took out his watch and
kept looking at it, while he went outdoors
to wait. He had not long to wait,
for the Runaway Bunny soon came in
sight. He cried:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I’m the Runaway Bunny. I’ve come all the way</div>
      <div class='line'>To say, ‘How do you do?’ and wish you good day.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He set down his traveling bag and
kissed his grandparents.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Mother Bun said, “You are our
own dear grandson.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Father Bun said, “Come right inside,
my dear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Runaway Bunny was glad to
sit down by the kitchen stove and eat
cookies as fast as Old Mother Bun took
them out of the oven.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_xiii'></a>Now he had heard the old Rabbits
wishing before he had entered the
house. So he went pitter, patter, clitter,
clatter, down to the cellar and
brought up a great green cabbage.
He put it into a chopping bowl and
chopped it up for dinner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he went pitter, patter, clitter,
clatter, down to the cellar and
<a id='Page_xiv'></a>brought up many other good things.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Mother Bun said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You are such a little treasure,</div>
      <div class='line'>To keep you here will be a pleasure.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/fig05.jpg' alt='“The Runaway Bunny winked one eye”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“The Runaway Bunny winked one eye”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>At this the Runaway Bunny winked
one eye; for he never stayed anywhere
very long.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had formed the habit of running
away.</p>

<p class='c007'>He next went with a hop and a skip
and a bound, and brought in wood
and water.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Father Bun was delighted. He
said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I swear, by my long and floppy ears,</div>
      <div class='line'>I will keep you here for years and years!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<a id='Page_xv'></a><img src='images/fig06.jpg' alt='“Opened his traveling bag”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Opened his traveling bag”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_xvi'></a>The Runaway Bunny looked cross-eyed;
but he had a merry time all day.</p>

<p class='c007'>He said, “Grandmother Bun, what
a fine pantry you have!” and “Grandfather
Bun, what a fine garden you
have! Will you take me riding in your
wheelbarrow?”</p>

<p class='c007'>When evening came he and his
grandparents popped corn. And when
it was bedtime the Runaway Bunny
opened his traveling bag and brought
out a brand new nightcap for Old
Mother Bun and a brand new pipe for
Old Father Bun.</p>

<p class='c007'>They said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We love you so, we’ll keep you, honey.</div>
      <div class='line'>Please say you’ll live with us, little Bunny.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_xvii'></a>The Runaway Bunny coughed politely
and took his little brown traveling
bag and went pitter, patter, clitter,
clatter, upstairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>He put on his little white nightcap
and night robe.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<a id='Page_xviii'></a><img src='images/fig07.jpg' alt='“Tucked him up snug and warm”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Tucked him up snug and warm”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Old Mother Bun tucked him up
snug and warm in bed, and Old Father
Bun sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Tra, la, la, la! To sing’s a habit.</div>
      <div class='line'>Pleasant dreams, dear little Rabbit!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>When the little fellow was asleep,
Old Mother Bun said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I hope he will stay a year and a day,</div>
      <div class='line'>I think he forgot about running away.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Old Father Bun remarked:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“If he stays through one night, all will be well,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In the morning the Runaway Bunny
was gone!</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_xix'></a>He left his little brown traveling
bag, so it looked as though he intended
to come back some time. He also left
a polite note to thank his grandparents

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Runaway Bunny went hippety-hop;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He was hungry as could be.</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh, Runaway Bunny, will you stop</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And take a bite with me?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Runaway Bunny took out his
little toy watch and looked at it. And,
though he could not tell time, he said,
“My fur and cottontail! It seems to
be time for something to eat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He decided to ask the first animal
he met for some breakfast.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went hopping and skipping
along until he met Pit-A-Pat, the Cat.
He told her how very hungry he was.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Told her how very hungry he was”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>She said, “Come home with me and
I’ll give you a saucer of milk.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Runaway Bunny replied:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_xxii'></a>“I don’t drink milk, though you think it funny;</div>
      <div class='line'>I am a peculiar Runaway Bunny.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Then he whispered to Pit-A-Pat that
he wished he had stopped for Old
Mother Bun’s breakfast, and he went
hopping down the path.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pit-A-Pat remarked, “I ought to
have asked who Mother Bun is. I
might want to know some day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>My, how hungry the Runaway
Bunny was! By and by he met Rough
Coat, the old tramp dog, and asked
him for a tiny bite of breakfast.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/fig10.jpg' alt='“By and by he met Rough Coat”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“By and by he met Rough Coat”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Rough Coat said, “If you come with
me I will give you a fine bone I buried
last week.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Runaway Bunny bowed politely
and said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_xxiii'></a>“I can’t eat bones, though you think it funny;</div>
      <div class='line'>I am a peculiar Runaway Bunny.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“What are you running away for?”
asked Rough Coat.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_xxiv'></a>But the little fellow was in too much
of a hurry to stop to answer him. He
could not forget how hungry he was.</p>

<p class='c007'>He sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The Runaway Bunny is sad, you see,</div>
      <div class='line'>For he is hungry as he can be.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A wise old owl in the tree overhead,
who said his name was Who-Who, offered
the Rabbit a juicy bat.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the Runaway Bunny replied:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I can’t eat bats, though you think it funny;</div>
      <div class='line'>I am a peculiar Runaway Bunny.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He went on hippety-hop, hippety-hop,
until he met Old Brother Bear,
who offered him a taste of honey.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_xxv'></a>Now Old Brother Bear loved honey.
So he was relieved when the Runaway
Bunny replied:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I can’t eat honey, though you think it funny;</div>
      <div class='line'>I am a peculiar Runaway Bunny.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He went on his way, singing about
Old Mother Bun’s coffee and rolls and
doughnuts.</p>

<p class='c007'>He sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, the best things to eat for a Bunny on the run</div>
      <div class='line'>Are the rolls and the doughnuts of our Grandmother Bun.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Next he met Foxy-Lox, that sly old
fellow! The Runaway Bunny fairly
shouted:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_xxvi'></a>“My fur and whiskers! I have to shout,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’m so hungry I don’t know what I’m about.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Foxy-Lox crept up very, very close
and whispered in the Runaway Bunny’s
right ear:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hungry for carrots and everything nice,</div>
      <div class='line'>I can supply you in just a trice.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Then Foxy-Lox, that crafty old fellow,
crept up and whispered in the
Runaway Bunny’s left ear:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hungry for cabbage and vegetables green,</div>
      <div class='line'>You’re the hungriest Bunny I’ve ever seen.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_xxvii'></a>No wonder the Runaway Bunny
was hungry. No breakfast, no dinner,
no supper!</p>

<p class='c007'>Foxy-Lox said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_xxviii'></a>“Come with me into my den,</div>
      <div class='line'>My children are little gentlemen.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Runaway Bunny followed him,
muttering:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“At the home of good Old Mother Bun,</div>
      <div class='line'>There are plenty of meals for everyone.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>They went along until they came to
the den.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a table set with carrots
and cabbage and tender green spring-flower
shoots and everything else, in
fact, that a hungry Bunny would like
to eat.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/fig11.jpg' alt='“Waiting their turn to be served”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Waiting their turn to be served”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Sure enough, the six little Foxy-Loxies
sat like little gentlemen round
the table, waiting their turn to be
served.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_xxix'></a>Old Foxy-Lox invited the Runaway
Bunny to eat a good square meal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nodding his head in the direction of
the visitor, he whispered to his little
Foxes:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You will make a meal, ’tis true,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then we’ll make a meal of you!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Runaway Bunny had sharp
ears. He began to twitch them nervously
to and fro.</p>

<p class='c007'>He could not hear what Old Foxy-Lox
was whispering about. But he
thought the old fellow was up to some
mischief. So he said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I won’t eat cabbage, though you think it funny;</div>
      <div class='line'>I am a peculiar Runaway Bunny.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_xxx'></a>Then he looked at the carrots and
said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I won’t eat carrots, though you think it funny;</div>
      <div class='line'>I am a peculiar Runaway Bunny.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Then he waved his paw toward the
table of tempting things.</p>

<p class='c007'>And he shouted:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I won’t eat at all, though you think it funny;</div>
      <div class='line'>I am a peculiar Runaway Bunny.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Then he gave one bound and was
out of the den before Foxy-Lox could
wink an eyelash.</p>

<p class='c007'>His talkative little ticking Watch
made this remark:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_xxxi'></a>“We don’t care how hard the climb;</div>
      <div class='line'>Friend Bunny, you got out just in time!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_xxxii'></a>The Runaway Bunny was thinking
hard again, “No breakfast, no dinner,
no supper!” He sat down on a log to
think.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pitter, patter, clitter, clatter, came
the sound of two little feet. And another
Bunny stood in the path before
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>This new friend now said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I went to the side show and took in money,</div>
      <div class='line'>So you may call me a wee Circus Bunny.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/fig12.jpg' alt='“Then he stood on his head”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Then he stood on his head”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Then he stood on his head and did
several circus tricks, as cunning as
could be. At any other time the Runaway
Bunny would have laughed. But
he only said mournfully:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_xxxiii'></a>“The world is large, the world is wide,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I am empty quite—inside!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Circus Bunny said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We’re very near a garden plot,</div>
      <div class='line'>We shall find a good meal, like as not.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<a id='Page_xxxiv'></a><img src='images/fig13.jpg' alt='“They had a fine meal”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“They had a fine meal”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>They went hippety-hop until they
came to the garden. Here they ate the
tops of some early spring flowers and
some bits of tender lettuce. They had
a fine meal before they were through
with it. The Circus Bunny said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Let’s live in the garden a night and a day.</div>
      <div class='line'>There’s plenty of lettuce; come, what do you say?”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But the Runaway Bunny was off with a hop,</div>
      <div class='line'>With his ears and his tail going flippety-flop.</div>
      <div class='line'>The surprised Circus Bunny remarked, “That is funny!</div>
      <div class='line'>That rabbit is surely the Runaway Bunny.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_xxxv'></a>
  <h2 id='chap3' class='c005'>Chapter III <br /> A LOAD OF EASTER EGGS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>As the Runaway Bunny hopped
along, it began to rain very hard.</p>

<p class='c007'>He heard a voice singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I like the thunderstorm and rain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Just why I do I can’t explain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The voice came from a wee house
in the woods. The Runaway Bunny
stopped and knocked politely at the
door.</p>

<p class='c007'>His little heart went thump, for
he did not know what he should find
inside.</p>

<p class='c007'>The door opened a little and a
very old Rabbit peeped out and said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_xxxvi'></a>“I am Old Mother Give-Away;</div>
      <div class='line'>And now, sir, what have you to say?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Runaway Bunny hung his
head, for he had never been generous
enough to give away anything in all
his life. But as the rain was falling
fast, he wanted to go in and dry his
fur and whiskers.</p>

<p class='c007'>So he said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“May I do any errands for you today?</div>
      <div class='line'>I like to travel away, away.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In answer to this, the door was
opened wide and he hopped inside.</p>

<p class='c007'>My, what a wonderful sight he saw!</p>

<p class='c007'>There were Easter eggs on the table
and Easter eggs on the floor, Easter
eggs on the window-sill and Easter
<a id='Page_xxxvii'></a>eggs in baskets! They were painted
in gay colors—red, blue, and gold.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Mother Give-Away said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A messenger I thought I’d borrow;</div>
      <div class='line'>You may help me take the eggs to-morrow.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/fig14.jpg' alt='“Painting piles and piles of Easter eggs”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Painting piles and piles of Easter eggs”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Then she told him how she and
<a id='Page_xxxviii'></a>Father Give-Away had spent many
days painting piles and piles of Easter
eggs.</p>

<p class='c007'>She said she wanted every Rabbit
in the world to have an Easter egg on
Easter morning. She wanted the eggs
well hidden, so it would be fun to hunt
for them.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/fig15.jpg' alt='“Splashing the colors upon them”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Splashing the colors upon them”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>She went on painting the eggs,
dashing and splashing the colors upon
them. The Runaway Bunny planned
where he would hide the Easter eggs
in every wee house he visited.</p>

<p class='c007'>He thought he would put them back
of books and in vases and back of
clocks and in cups and bowls and
baskets. There are so many good
places to hide wee Easter eggs.</p>

<p class='c007'>By and by the two Bunnies curled
up on the rug and fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_xl'></a>Very early next day the Runaway
Bunny woke up.</p>

<p class='c007'>He said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“May I start with the Easter eggs today?</div>
      <div class='line'>Please let me go, Mother Give-Away.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>To his surprise Old Mother Give-Away
answered, as though she were
half asleep:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Speak to the Rubbers on the floor;</div>
      <div class='line'>They’ve heard that question asked before.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Runaway Bunny laughed and
slipped four little Rubbers on his four
little feet to keep them dry, this misty,
moisty morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he asked again:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_xlii'></a>“May I start with the Easter eggs to-day?</div>
      <div class='line'>Please let me go, Mother Give-Away.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Then the Rubbers piped up to answer
him:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ask the Umbrella in the hall;</div>
      <div class='line'>It may not answer you at all.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>“The Umbrella was in a very good humor”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Umbrella was in a very good
humor and, as the Runaway Bunny
opened it, said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ask the Raincoat what he will say</div>
      <div class='line'>About going out on a rainy day!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Runaway Bunny chuckled as
he slipped on the Raincoat that hung
on a nail.</p>

<p class='c007'>He asked as before:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_xliii'></a>“May I start with the Easter eggs to-day?</div>
      <div class='line'>Please let me go, Mother Give-Away.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Raincoat replied:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ask the Rain Cap; perhaps he’ll explain</div>
      <div class='line'>Why we’re happy when we hear the rain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Runaway Bunny knew they
were happy to get out in the rain. But
he asked again:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“May I start with the Easter eggs to-day?</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Rain Cap replied:</p>

      <div class='line'>The home into which each Easter egg goes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Then the Runaway Bunny ran out
<a id='Page_xlv'></a>into the yard and said to the Wheelbarrow:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Let’s start with the Easter eggs to-day;</div>
      <div class='line'>Come, Mr. Wheelbarrow, what do you say?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>And the Wheelbarrow said, “I am
ready to start this very minute.”</p>

<p>“About 246 Easter eggs in the Wheelbarrow”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Then Mother Give-Away came out
and helped the Runaway Bunny pile
about 246 Easter eggs in the Wheelbarrow.
She covered them well to keep
them dry.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Runaway Bunny remarked:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Now I should call this perfect fun,</div>
      <div class='line'>If I’d had breakfast with Grandmother Bun.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_xlvii'></a>“Who is Grandmother Bun?” asked
Old Mother Give-Away.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wind whistled so hard that the
Runaway Bunny did not hear the
question. But he went rolling the
Wheelbarrow merrily along, singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Perhaps you may think it very funny</div>
      <div class='line'>That I should be called an Easter Bunny.”</div>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>“He left eggs at every Rabbit house”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He left eggs at every Rabbit house
he passed, and by and by the Wheel-barrow
was empty.</p>

<p class='c007'>He left it in the road and went
hippety-hop along, singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I wish you all a glad Easter Day.</div>

  <h2 id='chap4' class='c005'>Chapter IV <br /> MOTHER BUN’S VISITORS</h2>
</div>
<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Said Mother Bun, “You may think it funny,</div>
      <div class='line'>But I miss my little Runaway Bunny.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Old Father Bun thought a long time
before speaking.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then said Father Bun, “Would it be wise,</div>
      <div class='line'>In all the papers to advertise?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Old Father and Mother Bun talked
on about the Runaway Bunny, saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In every newspaper in the wood</div>
      <div class='line'>We’ll advertise. It may do good.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_xlix'></a>So Old Father Bun sat down by a
table and said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“By my stubby tail, I shall have to think</div>
      <div class='line'>How to use paper and pen and ink.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He was not used to doing much
writing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Click, click, click,” went Old
Mother Bun’s knitting needles.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Puff, puff, puff,” went Old Father
Bun’s pipe.</p>

<p class='c007'>By and by he wrote the following:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Rabbit lost, Rabbit lost!</div>
      <div class='line'>Get him back at any cost.</div>
      <div class='line'>He runs away o’er hill and dale,</div>
      <div class='line'>He has long ears and stubby tail.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Old Mother Bun said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_l'></a>“I would nail that on a tree,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where every animal can see.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Old Father Bun did not agree with
her. He knew it paid to advertise in
newspapers. So he put on his old
felt hat, took his walking stick, and
started out to a real newspaper office.
He took his notice to Chatterbox, the
<a id='Page_li'></a>Monkey newspaper man. So all the
animals soon read in their newspapers
about the Runaway Bunny.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/fig19.jpg' alt='“He took his notice to Chatterbox”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“He took his notice to Chatterbox”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When Pit-A-Pat read the notice, she
smacked her lips and said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Here is a chance to have some fun,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll make a call on Old Mother Bun.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>So by and by it happened that Old
Father Bun said, “I hear the patter,
patter of little feet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Mother Bun said, “Do look out
and tell me who is coming.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Pit-A-Pat came to the door and
bowed politely, saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I long for milk. May I have a drink?</div>
      <div class='line'>I can help you find the Rabbit, I think.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<a id='Page_lii'></a><img src='images/fig20.jpg' alt='“Gave her a saucer of warm milk”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Gave her a saucer of warm milk”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>They gladly let Pit-A-Pat in and
gave her a saucer of warm milk in their
best blue-rimmed saucer.</p>

<p class='c007'>While she was licking her chops,
Old Father Bun said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To inquire of you seems rather funny,</div>
      <div class='line'>But did you meet our Runaway Bunny?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Old Mother Bun said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To call him Bunny we’ve formed the habit,</div>
      <div class='line'>He is also known as the Runaway Rabbit.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Did he have long ears?” asked Pit-A-Pat,
winking slyly. “Did he have a
tiny stubby tail?”</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_liii'></a>“Yes, yes,” shouted Father and
Mother Bun eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did he have a habit of running
away?” asked Pit-A-Pat, looking narrowly
out of her green eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes,” shouted Old Father and
Mother Bun again together.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_liv'></a>Then the most astonishing thing
happened!</p>

<p class='c007'>Pit-A-Pat got up slowly, humped
her back, and without another word
walked out of the open window!</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Mother Bun remarked:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“No use to cry for spilled milk, I see:</div>
      <div class='line'>Pit-A-Pat played a trick on me.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Old Father Bun said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I think her actions are very funny.</div>
      <div class='line'>She must have met our Runaway Bunny.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Rap-a-tap-tap,” sounded on the
door.</p>

<p class='c007'>And in walked Rough Coat, saying
politely:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_lv'></a>“I’m a lonesome fellow; I live alone.</div>
      <div class='line'>Could you give me as much as a chicken bone?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>As luck would have it, they had a
<a id='Page_lvi'></a>whole plate full of chicken bones in the
house. So Rough Coat had a wonderful
meal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Father Bun said, “Did you meet
our Runaway Bunny?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rough Coat said, “Did he run as
though he would never stop?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes,” cried Father Bun excitedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did he sometimes say, ‘My fur and
whiskers’?” asked Rough Coat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes,” cried Father and Mother
Bun together.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rough Coat gave himself a great
shake, remarking:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I enjoyed my lunch, I do declare;</div>
      <div class='line'>Ask your questions of Brother Bear.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/fig21.jpg' alt='“Whisk! with a bound he was gone!”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Whisk! with a bound he was gone!”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Whisk! with a bound he was gone!</p>

<p class='c007'>Father Bun said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_lvii'></a>“We’ll have other visitors some fine day,</div>
      <div class='line'>No telling, though, what our guests will say.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>At this very minute the Runaway
Bunny read in the newspaper about
himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>He read, “‘Bunny lost.’ That must
be I.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He twitched his long ears to and
fro and turned to look back at his little
stubby tail.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not want to go back and
visit his grandparents yet. So he
started on, saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I won’t stay still for a purse of money,</div>
      <div class='line'>I am such a funny Runaway Bunny!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_lviii'></a>
  <h2 id='chap5' class='c005'>Chapter V <br /> THE ANIMALS’ FOURTH OF JULY</h2>
</div>
<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We’ll have fun and frolic by and by,</div>
      <div class='line'>For soon will come the Fourth of July.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>So sang all the wild animals in the
woods.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Runaway Bunny ran on and on
until he could run no longer. Then
he set up a shout, for he had been
traveling in a circle, and here he was
back at his own little house in the
woods!</p>

<p class='c007'>There was his wee spinning wheel
in the corner. There were his dishes
on the table as he had left them.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/fig22.jpg' alt='“Then he began to spin furiously”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Then he began to spin furiously”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>He hopped into his wee bed and
slept a week and a day. Then he went
<a id='Page_lix'></a>down cellar and got a cabbage to eat.
He felt very happy. He wanted to
work. Then he began to spin furiously,
singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I can spin quite well if I only try,</div>
      <div class='line'>I will buy a flag for the Fourth of July.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Rap-a-tap,” sounded on his door
and in walked Pit-A-Pat, big as life
and twice as natural! She told the
<a id='Page_lx'></a>story about her little kittens who had
lost their mittens. The Runaway
Bunny listened earnestly, for he had
known what it was to be cold.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When I sell the goods I spin,” said Bunny,</div>
      <div class='line'>“For mittens I’ll give you a pile of money.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Pit-A-Pat bowed her thanks and the
Runaway Bunny began to spin again
in real earnest, saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I can spin quite well if I only try,</div>
      <div class='line'>“I’ll buy firecrackers for the Fourth of July.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Bowwow,” sounded outside the
window.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<a id='Page_lxi'></a><img src='images/fig23.jpg' alt='“There stood Rough Coat, growling”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“There stood Rough Coat, growling”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There stood Rough Coat, growling,
“I need a new collar. I want one with
my name and address upon it, so if I
get lost some one can lead me home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Runaway Bunny knew how
hard it was to want things. So he
whistled, and sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When I sell the goods I spin to-morrow,</div>
      <div class='line'>I shall have money for all to borrow.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Rough Coat went away happy.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_lxii'></a>“Whir, whir, whir,” went the cunning
little spinning wheel.</p>

<p class='c007'>All day long the Runaway Bunny
kept on spinning and telling what he
wanted to buy for himself with the
money, after his goods were sold.</p>

<p class='c007'>All day long the animals came and
begged him for money.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last he ran to the store and sold
the cloth he had spun. When he had
given the animals the money they
wanted, he said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I’m a Runaway Bunny and here I sigh,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ve nothing left for the Fourth of July.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“No flag, no firecrackers, no fireworks,”
called Old Who-Who, the Owl.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_lxiii'></a>The Runaway Bunny dried his eyes,
for he was so disappointed he had
shed a few tears. And he said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_lxiv'></a>“As long as I can make a rhyme,</div>

</div>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Pit-A-Pat came with a large flag”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He was just starting to run away
when there was a great noise and Pit-A-Pat
came with a large flag as a present,
and Rough Coat brought firecrackers.
Soon all the animals gathered
together for a surprise party and
they set off fireworks and drank red
lemonade.</p>

<p class='c007'>They all had a happy Fourth of
July.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Three Little Kittens wore their
new mittens and Rough Coat wore a
new collar. All the animals hugged
and kissed the Runaway Bunny and
begged him to stay with them in the
woods.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly, without any warning
<a id='Page_lxv'></a>whatever, he took his flag and, singing
a song to himself, went hippety-hop
down the road.</p>

<p class='c007'>He sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The Fourth of July is a holiday;</div>
      <div class='line'>And I’m running away, I’m running away!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>All the animals clapped their paws
and cried:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Please stay with us and forget the habit</div>

  <h2 id='chap6' class='c005'>Chapter VI <br /> THE COUNTY FAIR</h2>

<p class='c006'>The Runaway Bunny went hopping

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When I am lonesome I’m always singing</div>

      <div class='line'>And I said to old earth, ‘Good-bye, good-bye!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Good-bye, good-bye,” called a
merry voice; and there in the path before
the Runaway Bunny stood the
Circus Bunny.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Circus Bunny said:</p>

<p class='c010'>“To whom were you saying good-bye?”
asked the Runaway Bunny.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will answer that question when
you tell me about the wonderful ride
you had with the kite,” answered the
Circus Bunny.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the Runaway Bunny had already
forgotten about the kite and
could think of nothing but the fair. He
was delighted to have company on
the way; and he remarked:</p>

<p class='c010'>What a fine trip they had!</p>

<p class='c007'>Everyone was going to the fair.
Some of the animals were going on
foot and some were going on horseback.
Some of them rode in state in

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Will you spend a penny and form the habit</div>
      <div class='line'>Of calling to see the Circus Rabbit?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>They arrived at the fair. But just
as they were going to set up a wee
tent of their own and make money
for themselves, some one picked them
up by their long ears and put them in
a wire cage.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/fig25.jpg' alt='“Picked them up by their long ears”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Picked them up by their long ears”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The Circus Bunny whispered:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Well, this is a pretty how-do-you-do!</div>
      <div class='line'>I don’t know how to get out. Do you?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Runaway Bunny answered:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_lxxi'></a>“I really haven’t a word to say,</div>
      <div class='line'>This may cure me of running away!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>By and by a man came and called
out:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Performing Rabbits! Step this way!</div>
      <div class='line'>Hear what the Bunnies have to say;</div>
      <div class='line'>Their tricks are funny, and each small Bunny</div>
      <div class='line'>Is well worth all your admission money.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Now crowds and crowds gathered
around the cage. The Circus Bunny
stood on his head and turned somersaults
and said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Will you spend a penny and form the habit</div>
      <div class='line'>Of calling to see the Circus Rabbit?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_lxxii'></a>All the animals in the crowd
cheered and clapped, and cried, “Do
it again! Do it again!”</p>

<p class='c007'>By and by the Circus Bunny grew
tired of performing his tricks, and it
was the Runaway Bunny’s turn to entertain
the crowd.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had never done a trick in all his
life and was wondering what to do,
when the Circus Bunny reminded him:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You were singing a very comical song,</div>
      <div class='line'>As I was coming along, along.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>So the Runaway Bunny sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When I am lonesome I’m always singing</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a jolly old kite that used to fly</div>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_lxxiv'></a>At the end of the string I was often swinging,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I said to old earth, ‘Good-bye, good-bye!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/fig26.jpg' alt='“Up, up, up he began to sail”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Up, up, up he began to sail”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>At this very minute the most surprising
thing happened!</p>

<p class='c007'>The Runaway Bunny was so little
that he squeezed out through the wires
in the cage door! He took hold of the
string of a kite that was near, and up,
up, up he began to sail, higher and
higher, until he soon looked like a
speck in the sky.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” remarked the Circus Bunny,
“it was certainly fortunate that the
jolly old kite was waiting for him.
That is a new way he has found of
running away. I believe I will squeeze
out of this cage, too.”</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_lxxv'></a>So while the crowd was watching
the Runaway Bunny, he tried to get
out of the cage. But he stuck halfway,
until kind-hearted Old Mother Bun
pulled him out and tucked him safely
in her market basket.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Father Bun said, “What is in
your basket?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Mother Bun said, “I will tell
you when we get home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Up, up, up sailed the Runaway
Bunny.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he had sailed up a week and
a day, down, down sailed the kite and
he arrived in his own little back yard,
at home.</p>

<p class='c007'>He said, “I shall have a fine kite
story to tell my great-great-grand-children
some day. That was a fine
ride I had!”</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_lxxvi'></a>Then he repeated in a singsong way:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When I am lonesome I’m always singing</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a jolly old kite that used to fly</div>
      <div class='line'>At the end of the string I was often swinging,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I said to old earth, ‘Good-bye, good-bye!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He made himself a nice little supper
and for once was contented to sit in
his wee house. But that night he
dreamed that he was running away,
singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For a county fair I do not care,</div>
      <div class='line'>I can run away from anywhere,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wherever I go this thing I say,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘I’m running away! I’m running away!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_lxxvii'></a>
  <h2 id='chap7' class='c005'>Chapter VII <br /> THE BUNNY SCHOOL</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The summer had passed and September
had come. All the school bells
were ringing.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Runaway Bunny said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There is one thing I can remember,</div>
      <div class='line'>School begins in glad September.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Went hippety-hop down the path”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He packed his neat little dinner pail
and went hippety-hop down the path,
singing happy little songs like this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Runaway Bunny, as a rule,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Likes to run away,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Runaway Bunny said, “To school</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I go this September day.</div>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_lxxviii'></a>“I don’t know the words,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I don’t know the tune.</div>
      <div class='line'>I’m the Runaway Bunny;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I’ll get to school soon.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t be so sure of that,” called
Pit-A-Pat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t be so sure you’ll get there
soon,” said Rough Coat.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_lxxix'></a>“You may not get there until afternoon,”
growled Old Brother Bear.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I never before have made a rhyme,</div>
      <div class='line'>But I think you’ll not get there on time!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>whispered Old Foxy-Lox, peering at
the Runaway Bunny from his hiding
place.</p>

<p class='c007'>The school bells all sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Come to school. Ding, dong!</div>
      <div class='line'>Don’t be late. Run along!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>At this very minute the Runaway
Bunny thought of something he had
forgotten.</p>

<p class='c007'>He stopped short in the path, saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_lxxx'></a>“I’ll hide my dinner pail in the wood</div>
      <div class='line'>And get me a pencil as a rabbit should!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He put his dinner pail down by a
log and went hurrying home to get
a lead pencil. Soon he came back hippety-hop
with his pencil in his overalls
pocket.</p>

<p class='c007'>He stopped to look for his dinner
pail. It was gone!</p>

<p class='c007'>He shouted to Pit-A-Pat, who had
gone on ahead:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To get to school I will not fail,</div>
      <div class='line'>But where, oh where is my dinner pail?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Pit-A-Pat said she knew nothing
about the lost dinner pail.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_lxxxii'></a>Soon the Runaway Bunny caught
up with Rough Coat and said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“It makes me shake my stubby tail</div>
      <div class='line'>To think I lost my dinner pail.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/fig28.jpg' alt='“Brother Bear came up and whispered softly”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Brother Bear came up and whispered softly”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Then Brother Bear came up and
whispered softly:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ask Foxy-Lox down in his den,</div>
      <div class='line'>And his little gentlemen!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Runaway Bunny was very
angry to think Foxy-Lox would take
his dinner pail. He wanted to go to
Foxy-Lox’s house and get it back.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Old Brother Bear said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I’d rather lose a pail or two</div>
      <div class='line'>Than have him make a meal of you!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_lxxxiv'></a>The Runaway Bunny saw that
Brother Bear was right. It would never
do to go to Foxy-Lox’s house for his
dinner pail. Besides, that sly fox
would never give it back.</p>

<p class='c007'>So the Runaway Bunny ran on to
school and got there just two minutes
late.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/fig29.jpg' alt='“All the Bunnies were in their seats”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“All the Bunnies were in their seats”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>All the Bunnies were in their seats,
ready for work. The Runaway Bunny
took his seat and began to learn a
rhyme the rest were studying.</p>

<p class='c007'>He said it over to himself:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“September’s here to visit us,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In gold and russet gown;</div>
      <div class='line'>And we’ve been busy Bunnies since</div>
      <div class='line in2'>September’s come to town.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Runaway Bunny was a smart
<a id='Page_lxxxv'></a>little fellow. He liked to learn his
ABC’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>He learned to read very well and
he went to school sixteen days in
September.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then one bright afternoon he heard
the birds singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Good-bye, good-bye! To the South we go;</div>
      <div class='line'>Autumn is coming, and winter with snow.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He wished he could fly like his
feathered friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly he remembered how fast
he could run.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not wait for the close of
school but went hippety-hop out of the
window, singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_lxxxvi'></a>“Long ago I formed the habit</div>
      <div class='line'>Of running away. I’m the Runaway Rabbit.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He stayed in the woods all the rest
of September.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/fig30.jpg' alt='“Learned the names of the flowers”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Learned the names of the flowers”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>From Old Brother Bear he learned
<a id='Page_lxxxvii'></a>the names of all the fall fruits and
flowers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly he decided to go to town;
and he left the wild woods, singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The Runaway Bunny was made for play,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’m running away! I’m running away!</div>
      <div class='line'>Soon comes November, but still I’ll remember</div>
      <div class='line'>The things I have learned in happy September.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Runaway Bunny was running
away toward town.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Runaway Bunny could talk in rhyme,</div>
      <div class='line'>But for years and years he couldn’t tell time.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>One day the Runaway Bunny woke
up in his own little house and sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“It is such a pleasant autumn day,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’m really thinking of running away.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He put on his Wrist Watch for company,
though he could not tell time
to save his little stubby tail!</p>

<p class='c007'>He was going hippety-hop along
when he met Old Brother Bear. The
<a id='Page_lxxxix'></a>Bear passed the time of day, but
seemed to be in a terrible hurry and
growled:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“What is the real time? I fear I’m late,</div>
      <div class='line'>But I must get there, at any rate!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Where are you going?” inquired
the Runaway Bunny.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Old Brother Bear only hurried
on.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next Foxy-Lox came along and
chattered:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“What is the real time? I cannot wait,</div>
      <div class='line'>But I must get there, at any rate!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Where are you going?” asked the
Runaway Bunny.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Foxy-Lox had no time to answer
<a id='Page_xc'></a>him, and went hurrying down the
path without even a backward glance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Runaway Bunny said to himself:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To tell the time’s a convenient habit,</div>
      <div class='line'>For even a funny Runaway Rabbit.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Tick, tick, tick,” went the little
Wrist Watch and it sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To talk a little is my turn,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll teach the time, if you want to learn.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>“The Runaway Bunny was surprised”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Runaway Bunny was surprised,
you may be sure, and put his
ear down close to the little watch to
listen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The little Wrist Watch continued:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_xci'></a>“To learn some things is in your power,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Runaway Bunny skipped this
way and that way, and sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“’Tis more fun making a simple rhyme,</div>

    </div>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_xcii'></a>The little Wrist Watch continued:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Let’s run a race. Come, who will win it?</div>
      <div class='line'>My long hand tells you of each minute.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Then the Runaway Bunny ran on
faster than ever and the tiny hands of
the Wrist Watch ran round its face.
Before he could believe it, the Runaway
Bunny was learning to tell time.</p>

<p class='c007'>He shouted:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A quarter of eight! I won’t be late;</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ve learned a little, at any rate.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He learned half past and a quarter
past and a quarter of the hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>He sang merrily:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He sat down and began to eat cabbage
leaves. My! how fresh and crisp
they were!</p>

<p class='c007'>He began to wonder about the animals
he had met. He wondered where
they could be going. Don’t you wonder,
too?</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_xciv'></a>All this time Old Brother Bear was
on his way to the home of Father and

<p>“Gave him a plate of cakes”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Seeing that Old Brother Bear was
friendly, Old Father Bun allowed him
to sit in a rocking chair by the fire.
Old Mother Bun gave him a plate of
cakes, smoking hot, with honey on
them. Old Mother Bun said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I hope, kind sir, that you like honey;</div>
      <div class='line'>It makes me think of our Runaway Bunny.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_xcvi'></a>“Did he have long ears and a tiny
tail?” asked Old Brother Bear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes,” shouted Old Mother
Bun.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did he carry a little Wrist Watch?”
asked Old Brother Bear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes,” shouted Old Father Bun.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Old Brother Bear, who was
something of a joker, smacked his lips
and said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Such fine cakes are worth much money,</div>
      <div class='line'>I also thank you for the honey.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>So saying, he bowed politely and
walked out of the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Mother Bun remarked:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I really think it very funny,</div>
      <div class='line'>He would not talk of the Runaway Bunny.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_xcvii'></a>Old Father Bun’s head went nid-nid-nodding.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/fig35.jpg' alt='“Up walked Old Foxy-Lox”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Up walked Old Foxy-Lox”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Up walked Old Foxy-Lox, tapping
on the window pane.</p>

<p class='c007'>Foxy-Lox asked for cookies and
honey, but Old Mother Bun would not
let him in.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went off, shouting:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_xcviii'></a>“I saw the Runaway Rabbit to-day,</div>
      <div class='line'>And as usual he was running away.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Call him back! Call him back!”
called Old Father Bun, who had waked
up in time to hear Foxy-Lox shout.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mother Bun shook her head as she
counted her silver spoons, saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Though it may seem to you absurd,</div>
      <div class='line'>He sometimes robs good folk, I’ve heard.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Old Father Bun said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Alackaday! What shall I say?</div>
      <div class='line'>Will the Runaway Bunny come back some day?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>While all this was going on, the
<a id='Page_xcix'></a>Runaway Bunny continued to eat as
much cabbage as he wanted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The little Wrist Watch said to him:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To tell the time is a useful habit;</div>
      <div class='line'>Let’s see you do it, you cunning Rabbit!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Runaway Bunny had really
learned to tell the time. But he
wanted to tease, so he said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“It is bedtime, bedtime,</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er all the world in every clime.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Then he curled up in a hole in a
hollow tree and went to sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the time, his little Wrist Watch
ticked busily on.</p>

<p class='c007'>For all who wanted to hear, it sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_c'></a>“For hours and hours I tick away,</div>

      <div class='line'>“My long hand always points the minute;</div>
      <div class='line'>And how much good can you do in it?</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“My short hand always points the hour;</div>
      <div class='line'>To learn it is within your power.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For telling time’s an easy trick</div>
      <div class='line'>If you have learned arithmetic.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>That night the Runaway Rabbit
cried out in his sleep:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“It is warm in a hollow tree, I declare;</div>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>“The Market Basket cried out”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>One day late in November, the Runaway
Rabbit sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To Grandma Bun I’ll hurry away,</div>
      <div class='line'>To help her keep Thanksgiving Day.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_cii'></a>He had gone hippety-hop only a
little way when he sat down on a stone
to think.</p>

<p class='c007'>To his surprise, the Market Basket
he carried cried out:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Will you buy a turkey while on your way,</div>
      <div class='line'>For Old Mother Bun’s Thanksgiving Day?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Dear me! My fur and whiskers, I
never thought about that!” he cried.
“Of course I will—now that you suggest
it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He rattled the pennies in his little
bead purse. He rattled the dimes and
quarters.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went hippety-hop to the market
and said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_civ'></a>“Will you sell me a turkey of eighteen pounds?</div>
      <div class='line'>How very grand that order sounds!”</div>

  </div>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Surprised the butcher”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>To see such a little fellow with so
much money surprised the butcher.
But he weighed the turkey and it quite
filled the Market Basket.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Runaway Bunny was starting
merrily down the road, when the Basket
cried:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Each Thanksgiving people sigh</div>
      <div class='line'>For rich and spicy pumpkin pie.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Runaway Bunny saw a nice
yellow pumpkin in a field and he managed
to tuck it under his arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>He arrived home and began to
make a pumpkin pie. He measured
<a id='Page_cv'></a>this, weighed that, and cut up and
cooked the pumpkin.</p>

<p class='c007'>He baked a wonderful pumpkin pie
and was about ready to set out again,
when the Basket cried:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Fine potatoes are a treat</div>
      <div class='line'>On Thanksgiving, if they’re sweet.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Runaway Bunny threw his
little red cap up in the air, shouting,
“Sweet potatoes, sweet potatoes!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/fig38.jpg' alt='“He pared them and cut them up”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“He pared them and cut them up”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>So, leaving his turkey and pie, he
<a id='Page_cvi'></a>ran hippety-hop to the grocer’s and
bought sweet potatoes and took them
home. He pared them and cut them
up. He pared some carrots, too. Then
he put them all on to cook.</p>

<p class='c007'>He sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I’m the Runaway Bunny; I talk in rhyme;</div>
      <div class='line'>It is lucky I started out on time.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The basket spoke again and said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I don’t believe I have heard you say</div>
      <div class='line'>If you’ve cranberries for Thanksgiving Day.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Runaway Bunny ran quickly
for cranberries.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was back in less than no time,
<a id='Page_cvii'></a>and began to pack his Basket to
take with him to spend the day with
Old Mother Bun.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this very minute “Rap-a-tap!”
was heard on the door; and in walked
his old friends, Pit-A-Pat, Rough Coat,
Old Brother Bear, and Foxy-Lox.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Said Foxy-Lox, “Shall we be in the way,</div>
      <div class='line'>If we travel with you on Thanksgiving Day?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Pit-A-Pat began to lick her chops
as she smelled the gravy. For the Runaway
Bunny had the dinner all cooked
to take with him, of course.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rough Coat thought of the turkey
legs. Old Brother Bear smelled the
sweet potatoes.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_cviii'></a>Old Foxy-Lox had a long head on
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>So he said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Let’s set the table here just to see</div>
      <div class='line'>How fine your Thanksgiving dinner will be.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Runaway Bunny switched his
ears to and fro. But he let the animals
help him set the table with turkey,
gravy, sweet potatoes, cranberries,
and pumpkin pie. And every minute
he grew more and more hungry himself.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/fig39.jpg' alt='“He grew more and more hungry”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“He grew more and more hungry”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Foxy-Lox said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Though we do not intend to be impolite,</div>
      <div class='line'>Let’s taste to see if the dinner is right.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_cx'></a>The Runaway Bunny enjoyed a
joke as well as anyone.</p>

<p class='c007'>So he said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I am really amused at what you say;</div>
      <div class='line'>Come, help yourself on Thanksgiving Day!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Then they all had a fine feast.</p>

<p class='c007'>The visitors felt a little guilty and
whispered among themselves:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We think our conduct is rather shocking,</div>
      <div class='line'>But we will fill his Christmas stocking.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Runaway Bunny excused himself,
saying he wanted some exercise.</p>

<p class='c007'>And he sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_cxi'></a>“I like to travel; I’ve formed the habit;</div>
      <div class='line'>I am well named the Runaway Rabbit.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He ran off through the woods away,
away, away! Would he never stop?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_cxii'></a>
  <h2 id='chap10' class='c005'>Chapter X <br /> CHRISTMAS AT MOTHER BUN’S</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Old Mother Bun was very busy
making Christmas presents and Old
Father Bun was very busy wrapping
them up and putting the animals’
names upon them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every once in awhile, Old Mother
<a id='Page_cxiii'></a>Bun would say, “Did you remember
Old Father Chipmunk?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Old Father Bun would say,
“Did you remember Old Grandfather
Weasel?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Click, click, click,” went Old
Mother Bun’s knitting needles, as she
knitted scarfs and sweaters and caps
for the animals.</p>

<p class='c007'>One evening Old Father Bun said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_cxiv'></a>“Are the stockings ready to hang? Because</div>
      <div class='line'>It is almost time for Santa Claus.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/fig41.jpg' alt='“There were three stockings”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“There were three stockings”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Old Mother Bun got out a big stocking,
a little stocking, and a middle-sized
stocking, saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We’ll hang up three, though it seems so funny;</div>
      <div class='line'>We’ll put one up for the Runaway Bunny.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>So there were three stockings hanging
by the fireplace. And every hour
it grew nearer and nearer Christmas
Eve.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now wasn’t it odd? At this very
minute the Runaway Bunny was saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_cxv'></a>“By my stubby tail, at least I remember</div>
      <div class='line'>That Santa Claus comes late in December!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He looked down the path that led
to the woods toward Old Mother Bun’s
home, singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ha, ha! I must be off to-day.</div>
      <div class='line'>I’m running away! I’m running away!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He ran on happily.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_cxvi'></a>Suddenly he stopped and remembered
he had no presents for Old
Mother Bun and Old Father Bun. So
back he went hippety-hop, hippety-hop,
to his little house; and up he went
into the attic and looked in an old
trunk.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/fig42.jpg' alt='“Looked in an old trunk”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Looked in an old trunk”</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ha, ha!” he cried. “I call this fun;</div>
      <div class='line'>Here is a pipe for Grandfather Bun.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Sure enough, there was a brand new
pipe in a red velvet case. He looked
down deeper in the trunk and found
something else.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ha, ha!” he cried. “Presents for everyone!</div>
      <div class='line'>Here are spectacles for Grandmother Bun.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_cxviii'></a>He put his presents in a little bag
and went off hippety-hop, singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I hope I shall get there by break of day;</div>
      <div class='line'>I’m running away! I’m running away!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Sometimes he stopped to rest and
cried:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“My fur and whiskers! It’s cold as ice!</div>
      <div class='line'>I forgot my mittens, so warm and nice.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>His little sweater did not keep him
warm enough.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/fig43.jpg' alt='“He was getting colder every minute”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“He was getting colder every minute”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>His little paws were very cold! His
long ears were even colder! He was
getting colder every minute as he went
hippety-hop across the snow!</p>

<p class='c007'>The next minute he jumped into
<a id='Page_cxix'></a>such a deep snowdrift that only his
long ears stuck out. The snow got into
his nose and eyes until he could
scarcely breathe. He tried to wriggle
out, but the drift held him fast.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle went some
<a id='Page_cxx'></a>sleigh bells. And a funny old man,
dressed in fur from top to toe and carrying
a big pack on his back, came
riding along.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I carry presents, as is my habit,</div>
      <div class='line'>Aha! I think I see a rabbit.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He got out of his sleigh and waded
into the snowdrift from which the Bunny’s
ears stuck out.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/fig44.jpg' alt='“Pulled the Runaway Bunny out”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Pulled the Runaway Bunny out”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Then he pulled the Runaway Bunny
out by the ears.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Runaway Bunny shook the
snow from his fur and looked at the
funny old man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, it’s Santa Claus!” shouted
that surprised Bunny. “Hurrah!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tut, tut! This is no time of night
<a id='Page_cxxi'></a>for little Bunnies to be out in the cold!”
cried Santa Claus. “Come with me and
you shall ride in my pack, where you
will be warm and dry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So the Runaway Bunny jumped into
<a id='Page_cxxii'></a>Santa’s pack and almost buried himself
among the toys. Then he rode
away, singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“It’s fun to go in Santa’s sleigh,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’m riding away! I’m riding away!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>They slid down many chimneys and
climbed over many roofs. Then away
they rode until by and by they came
to the home of Father and Mother Bun.
They peeped in at the window. There
sat old Father and Mother Bun fast
asleep in their armchairs.</p>

<p>“Crept down the chimney”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As Santa Claus crept down the
chimney, he whispered to the Runaway
Bunny, “You may help me, little
Bunny. You may trim the stockings
with holly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So he took a bunch of holly from
<a id='Page_cxxiii'></a>his pack and the Runaway Bunny fastened
sprays of it on the stockings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Santa whispered:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Curl up in a stocking and go to sleep;</div>
      <div class='line'>Be still as a mouse, and don’t you peep!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>So the Runaway Bunny took off his
little sweater, so that he would not be
too hot in the warm stocking. Then
Santa tucked him into Old Mother
Bun’s stocking. He put her presents
on the floor. Then he filled Old Father
Bun’s stocking from top to toe.</p>

<p class='c007'>He left a card on the table. He
wrote on the card:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Santa was here to pay a call;</div>
      <div class='line'>A merry Christmas to one and all!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_cxxiv'></a>Did they have a merry Christmas?
Well, I should think they did!</p>

<p class='c007'>Early Christmas morning, Old
Mother Bun awoke and cried:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I don’t see well, but it seems funny—</div>
      <div class='line'>Those look like the ears of the Runaway Bunny!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Next Old Father Bun awoke and
said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I see very well—I have formed the habit;</div>
      <div class='line'>Those look like the ears of the Runaway Rabbit.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Then Father Bun took hold of one
ear and Mother Bun took hold of the
other ear, and they pulled the Runaway
Bunny out of the stocking.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<a id='Page_cxxv'></a><img src='images/fig46.jpg' alt='“Pulled Bunny out by the ears”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Pulled Bunny out by the ears”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>They all cried, “Merry Christmas!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the Runaway Bunny gave
Mother Bun her spectacles and Father
Bun his pipe. And they had a merry
time with the presents Santa Claus
had brought them.</p>

<p class='c007'><a id='Page_cxxvi'></a>Old Mother Bun gave the Runaway
Bunny a new cap and sweater, and
Old Father Bun gave him a new sled.
Then the pair kissed him on both
cheeks and begged him to live with
them always. He said he would.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the Runaway Bunny put on
<a id='Page_cxxvii'></a>his new cap and sweater and went
coasting downhill on his new sled.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/fig47.jpg' alt='“Went coasting downhill”' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Went coasting downhill”</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The very last words that I heard him say</div>
      <div class='line'>Were, “With Grandpa and Grandma Bun I’ll stay,</div>
      <div class='line'>And if I live a year and a day,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’m entirely cured of running away!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>I wonder if he ever ran away after
that. I forgot to ask him!</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>If I were a Bunny, I do declare,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’d hang up a stocking with greatest care;</div>
      <div class='line'>And I’d always be very good because</div>
      <div class='line'>I’d hope for a visit from Santa Claus.</div>
      <div class='line'>And every winter I’d have the fun</div>
      <div class='line'>Of spending Christmas with Grandma Bun.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='Page_cxxviii'></a>Who’ll fill our stockings from top to toe?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Jolly Old Santa Claus!</div>
      <div class='line'>Who’ll laugh at the stockings all in a row?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Jolly Old Santa Claus!</div>
      <div class='line'>And all the children and bunnies cry,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Hurrah! hurrah! he is riding by!”</div>
